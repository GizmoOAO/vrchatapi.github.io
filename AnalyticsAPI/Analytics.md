# Analytics API 

!> Note, there are alot more analytics then this in-game, I am slowly going over and checking them so it might take some time until there is a full doc on exactly what the game tracks.

VRChat has some built-in analytics. They use [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) for managing the analytics.

Some events are considered in-session, and some out-of-session. In-Session events are sent while in game and out in session can be sent by other stuff, like using the unity SDK.

This is not an exact "How to use" documentation but only documents what the game collects and sends about the user and game.

The tracking VRChat does seems to be non-malicious and I would consider it as a pretty avarage tracking for most modern games.

## General Tracking

- [Unique Device ID](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-deviceUniqueIdentifier.html) - A unique device identifier. It is guaranteed to be unique for every device.
- Sessions (assuming photon) - every time the user switches session it sets the last session time and starts counting again.
