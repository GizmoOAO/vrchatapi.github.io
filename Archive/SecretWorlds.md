# Sercret Worlds

While documenting the API I found some worlds that are not normally accesible.....

## HAB01

This is interesting, in the remote config it is listed as `homeworldWorldId`, it was last updated in 24/1/2017 meaning that we might never actually see it ingame...

One theory is that HAB01 stands for HAbitat 01 and each player would have their own "house" eventually, sort of like the SteamVR home. Maybe you'd be able to buy props from the planned monetezation feature and place in your habitat.

Unlike most other VRChat created maps this map's Author is `AtomJaay`

You can not join into it, tried directly and tried using a portal in a custom worlds but both seem to just kick you back to the main hub.

?> **UPDATE** I was able to get VRChat to download the world by tricking it to think I can download it using the API, but unfortunately it did not work, the game is spitting NRE, Missing metadata key, ArgumentExceptions and more as loading the world, I might have not tricked the API hard enough to get it to actually run it, and maybe it simply can't, it was created with an old unity version, using an old SDK probably.
